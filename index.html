        <h1>High Radiation Warning
        </h1>
        <p>Get notified about high levels of radiation. When Wi-Fi reception is poor, mobile phones <br/> work harder to stay connected and emit more radiation.</p>
        <h1>Disconnect Bluetooth & Wi-Fi in your Pocket
        </h1>
        <p> <p> Pocket Mode protects your reproductive organs from exposure to radiation and heat. It smartly does it by disconnecting the Wi-fi and the Bluetooth, when in your pocket.</p>
            <br/>
            <img class="image-2" src="./images/pocket-mode-protection.jpg" alt="">
            When you put a smartphone in your pocket, your body is being exposed to EMF (Electromotive force) Radiation. EMF in smartphones comes with non-ionized radiation and heat.
            <br/><br/>
            SAR is a measure of energy that is absorbed by human tissue. This energy comes in the form of radiation and heat
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>


        <h2>Radiation Bodyguard knows when your phone is in your pocket
        </h2>
        <p>Some of the radiation and heat comes from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which are continuously scanning and connecting to networks around you.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The networks say to each other: hi, what’s your name, protocols, etc. That’s why, when the setting is turned on, you can immediately see the available Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks around you.</p>
        <p>
        <img class="image-3" src="./images/Pocket-Mode-Report.png" alt="">
        This is really unnecessary radiation and heat. You are anyway most likely walking in the street, and have no available Wi-Fi network.
        <br>
        It makes sense to avoid SAR radiation and heat so close to your reproductive organs.
            <br>
            
            <h2>When you turn on your phone’s screen or receive a call - immediately! Your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will be turned on.</h2>
            <p>
            Phone Radiation Bodyguard App knows when your mobile phone is in your pocket, and then turns off the Wi-Fi and/or the Bluetooth, as you choose.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            When you pull the smartphone out from your pocket - within 1 minute - your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will be turned on.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Don’t worry about not being able to get phone calls or notifications. If your 'mobile data' is turned on (and if you have an internet plan with your sim card provider) you still have an internet connection while the mobile is in your pocket.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Time Reports for Pocket Mode: The app measures how long Pocket Mode is working. The app displays the number of hours, days, weeks, or even years you save from unnecessary Wifi & Bluetooth radiation exposure.</p>
            <h1>Phone Distance Trainer for Children
            </h1>
            
            <img class="image-4" src="./images/children.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
            During a call, your phone emits more radiation. When holding your phone against your ear, there is no EMF protection between your cell phone and your brain.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?
            </h3>
            <p>
            When the proximity sensor is activated during a call, a vibration warns your child to move the phone away from their head.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Over time, the app will train your child to keep a distance between the smartphone and their head and body.</p>

        <p><img class="image-5" src="./images/daily-tips-news.png" alt=""> <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"> There are two ways to use the app. The first is to go with the default setting and get less phone radiation.</p>
            <br>

            <p>
            The second way is to get better optimization for a better balance between your digital life and your phone SAR radiation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            For example, Radiation Bodyguard App has a detailed setting about what to do when the phone is in the pocket.</p>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>Hello, I’m Shlomi Refaeli, creator of this App. The idea came from my worry about mobile phone radiation.sample-image
            So, I came with the idea to create an app which helps to reduce cell phone radiation, without affecting your day to day digital life.</p>
            <img src="./images/our-vision.jpg" width="100%" alt="">
            <h2>I believe it is better to be safe than sorry. It only makes sense to reduce radiation and heat exposure wherever possible.</h2>
            <p>Radiation Bodyguard cleverly optimizes the usage and settings of your phone's EMF emitters.</p>
            <p><strong>Does Radiation Bodyguard reduce the risk of 5G, cancer, or other health risks?</strong></p>
            <p>There have not been enough reliable research studies completed to prove whether EMF radiation causes health risks or not.</p>
            <img src="./images/smartpone-heat-effect.jpg" width="100%" alt="">
            <p>So far, no reliable source has published complete reaserch regarding the heat effects of EMF radiation on reproductive organs or posible links with low sperm counts and cancer.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I believe it is better to be safe than sorry. Without more information, it makes sense to reduce radiation and heat exposure wherever possible.</p>
            <p>Improve your digital wellness and install Radiation Bodyguard App today.</p>
